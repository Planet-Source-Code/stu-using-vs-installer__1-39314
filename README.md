## Using VS Installer\.


</div>

### Description

Having read peoples problems (and having had my own) with the Deployment Wizard, I suggest that you use Visual Studio Installer. It is a free download from Microsoft. The zip is a word doc (with some helpful pictures) that explains the basic use of the prog and where to get it. Hope it's useful.
